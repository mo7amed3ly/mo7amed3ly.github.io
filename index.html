      Hi, I am Mohamed Ali. I am a senior software developer. I have more than 17 years of experience in software development. 
      I started my journey in software development in 2003 as an SQL Developer. Gradualy, I moved my attention to web development using ASP.NET then Drupal. 
      After getting my Master degree in Computing, where my focus was on AI and Machine Learning, I started building NLP machine learning models to help computers understand human written language.
